<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
The problem was to create a sale website using React
The website had to consist of multiple implimations of code including routes and components

<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
I began planning by hand drawing a wireframe for what I wanted the website to look like
I decided that what I wanted to sell were collector's cards, this ended up turning my sale site into a collector's site
I wanted to tackle the hardest coding challenges first, so I planned out the order of programs that I would do

<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
I started by recycling my navigation bar to reinforce the use of routes
Then I moved onto coding the search bar because I figured that would take the most time. While coding I found implimented a filter within the search bar
After finishing the search bar I moved onto shopping list and hit a blocker, it took a few days working with TMs and other campers to move on from it and relearn the fundamentals
SNOW STORM HIT, NO POWER!!!
Implimented buttons within main page and cart
Created the product detail page, focusing on the transfer of specific data
I completed the MVP with full functionality

<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
After finishing the assignment I went back and started working on CSS, I wanted it to look nicer
I was really proud of the work I did since I had no previous experience with React or coding in general
